	constuctor(props)
	getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)

- Component Lifecycle - update
	getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)
	shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) - may cancel the rendering the component based on conditions
	render()
	Update Child Component Props
	getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)
	componentDidUpdate() - Shouldn't update the state to stop re-rendering
- useEffect is used to cover all lifecycle hooks of a class based component
