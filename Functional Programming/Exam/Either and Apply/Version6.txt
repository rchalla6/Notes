Question 1:
-----------

=>Reasoning: 

In shops there will be different amount of discounts for different purchase amounts. We will use either concept to calculate discounts and the 
conditions we take are no discounts for purchase amount below 100, 5% discount for purchase amount between 100 and 300 and 10% discount for 
purchases more than 300

=>Program:

using LaYumba.Functional;
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp
{
    class Program1
    {
        public static Either<string, double> disCount(int purchaseAmount)
        {
            if (purchaseAmount <= 0) return "Purchase amount should be more than 0 to check for discounts";
            if (purchaseAmount < 100) return " There is no discount for purchases for amount below $100";
            else if (purchaseAmount >= 100 && purchaseAmount < 300) return Math.Round((double)purchaseAmount * 0.05);
            return Math.Round((double)purchaseAmount * 0.1);
        }
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Discount for the purchase(-50) is - " + disCount(-50)); 
            Console.WriteLine("Discount for the purchase(180) is - " + disCount(180));
            Console.WriteLine("Discount for the purchase(320) is - " + disCount(320));
            Console.WriteLine("Discount for the purchase(90) is - " + disCount(90));
        }
    }
}

Question 2:
-----------

=>Reasoning: 

In shops we will have price for products and there will be discounts and the net price of the product will be original price - discount and tax
will be levied on this. We will use apply concept to find the final price of the product

=>Program:

using LaYumba.Functional;
using System;
using static LaYumba.Functional.F;

namespace ConsoleApp
{
    class Program2
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Func<double, double, double> priceAfterDiscount = (price, discount) => price - price * discount / 100;
            Func<double, int, double> finalPrice = (netPriceAfterDiscount, tax) => netPriceAfterDiscount + netPriceAfterDiscount * tax / 100;
            Console.WriteLine("Final price of product with original price of 100 and 5% discount and 8% tax is:" +
                Some(finalPrice).Apply(Some(priceAfterDiscount).Apply(100).Apply(5)).Apply(8));
            Console.WriteLine("Final price of product with original price of 100 and no discount and 10% tax is:" +
                Some(finalPrice).Apply(Some(priceAfterDiscount).Apply(100).Apply(0)).Apply(10));
        }
    }
}
