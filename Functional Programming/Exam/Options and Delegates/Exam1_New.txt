Question 1 on options:
----------------------

=>Reasoning: 
 
Check if a cricket player is eligible for an emerging player award or not in a cricket tournament.
The program is to find whether a player is eligible for emerging player award or not, depending on the data entered for each player.
User may enter any values for each player. Options is an useful programming topic here and it can have two states some (having value which
indicates player is eligible) or None (having no value which indicates player is not eligible).
Conditions for player to be eligible for an emerging player award:
- Age should be between 19-21 years old
If player is batsman:
- Scored atleast 300 runs
- Batting average is atleast 30
If player is bowler:
- Wickets taken are atleast 10
- Bowling average is max 15

Question 2 on options:
----------------------

=>Reasoning:

Check if a professional is eligible for interview or not.
The program is to find whether a professional is eligible for an interview or not, depending on the skill set entered for each professional.
User may enter different values for each professional. Options is an useful programming topic here and it can have two states some (having value 
which indicates professional is eligible) or None (having no value which indicates professional is not eligible).
Conditions for professional to be eligible for an interview:
- Experience should be atleast 2 years
- Should have skill set of C#, functional programming

Question 3 on multicast delegates:
----------------------------------

=>Reasoning: 

When we buy any items usually all the products are added to the cart and we have to calculate the net amount for all the products. 
Also we need to find the discount amount based on the discount of the store. Here we can use multicast to find different values using the same
invoke function in the delegate.
1. Calculate the total amount
2. Total discount
3. Get all the items in the cart

=>Program:

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace Exam
{
    public delegate void OrderProcessMethods(int orderId);
    class Program
    {
        static List<Tuple<int, Tuple<string, double>>> listOfOrderTuples;
        static void getShoppingItems(int orderId)
        {
            List<Tuple<int, Tuple<string, double>>> tuples = listOfOrderTuples.FindAll(x => x.Item1 == orderId);
            Console.WriteLine("\nItems in the cart for orderId: " + orderId);
            foreach (var tuple in tuples)
                Console.WriteLine(tuple.Item2.Item1);
        }
        static void getNetAmount(int orderId)
        {
            double totalAmount = 0;
            List<Tuple<int, Tuple<string, double>>> tuples = listOfOrderTuples.FindAll(x => x.Item1 == orderId);
            foreach (var tuple in tuples)
                totalAmount += tuple.Item2.Item2;
            Console.WriteLine("Net amount for the order is:" + Math.Round(totalAmount, 2));
        }
        static void getDiscountAmount(int orderId)
        {
            double totalAmount = 0;
            List<Tuple<int, Tuple<string, double>>> tuples = listOfOrderTuples.FindAll(x => x.Item1 == orderId);
            foreach (var tuple in tuples)
                totalAmount += tuple.Item2.Item2;
            Console.WriteLine("Discount amount for the order is:" + Math.Round(totalAmount * (0.15), 2));
        }
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            listOfOrderTuples = new List<Tuple<int, Tuple<string, double>>>
            {
                Tuple.Create(1, Tuple.Create("item1", 12.99)),
                Tuple.Create(1, Tuple.Create("item2", 13.00)),
                Tuple.Create(2, Tuple.Create("item1", 11.50)),
                Tuple.Create(2, Tuple.Create("item2", 8.99)),
                Tuple.Create(2, Tuple.Create("item3", 18.99))
            };

            Console.WriteLine("Using multicast delegate following details are calculated\n=>");
            OrderProcessMethods orderProcessMethodsDelegate = getShoppingItems;
            orderProcessMethodsDelegate += getNetAmount;
            orderProcessMethodsDelegate += getDiscountAmount;
            orderProcessMethodsDelegate.Invoke(1);
            orderProcessMethodsDelegate.Invoke(2);
        }
    }
}

Question 4 on multicast delegates:
----------------------------------

=>Reasoning: 

When we subscribe to a newsletter or any source module we usually get emails from the source related to successful subscription. Also along with this
confirmation email the source will also send other content emails regarding their new releases at once to the subscribers. In this scenario we can make 
use of the multicast delegates functionality.
In the following program we will be considering scenario of a person subscribing to a store. When the customer subscribes to the store application then 
the store will send an email regarding the successful subscription as well as another email regarding the offers running on the store.

=>Program:

using System;

namespace Exam
{
    public delegate void ProcessContentStore(string emailId, string content);
    class Program
    {
        static string stars = "*****************************************************************************";
        static Func<string,string, string, string> func = (header,emailId, content) => string.Join("\n", header, stars, content, stars);
        static void sendSuccessfulSubscriptionConfirmation(string emailId, string content)
        {
            string header = "Subscription confirmation email is sent with content";
            Console.WriteLine(func(header,emailId, content));
        }
        static void sendNewOffersInTheStore(string emailId, string content)
        {
            string header = "New offers email in the store information is sent with content";
            Console.WriteLine(func(header, emailId, content));
        }
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string email = "";
            Console.WriteLine("When the user visits the store there will be an option to subscribe to be store");
            Console.WriteLine("1. Please enter 1 to subscribe to news letter\n2. Exit\n\nEnter your choice:");
            int choice = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
            if (choice == 1)
            {
                Console.Write("Please enter your email address to subscribe:");
                email = Console.ReadLine();
            }
            ProcessContentStore processContentStoreDelegate = sendSuccessfulSubscriptionConfirmation;
            processContentStoreDelegate.Invoke(email, "Thank you for subscribing our store, You will receive an email shortly on the new offers on the stores");
            processContentStoreDelegate += sendNewOffersInTheStore;
            processContentStoreDelegate -= sendSuccessfulSubscriptionConfirmation;
            processContentStoreDelegate.Invoke(email, "Following are the new offers in the store: \n 10% on home kitchen products" +
                "\n 15% on electronics \n 20% on gardening products");
        }
    }
}
